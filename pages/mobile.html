        <h2>Small device repair</h2>
        <h3>Mobile Phones</h3>
        <p>Having the basic tools and knowledge, there isn't a phone I can't get into.  I have experience with Samsung models but, sadly, I do not owrk on Apple products, because of the expense of their tools and such as the 'closed' nature of their business.</p>
        <p>Broken Screens - Let me know of the model of the phone and I can order a part in with a warranty and fit the part</p>
        <p>Charger Ports - This can be a few things from fluff and dust having built up inside the port right up to a clean break of the cable, let me know and I can fix these</p>

        <h3>Tablets</h3>
        <p>Broken Screens - Tablets do tend to be quite expensive for screens as such, it is cheaper to buy a replacement device second hand or even new on sale. Regardless, much like mobile phones, once I know the model and part needed I have the tools and experience.</p>
        <p>Charger Ports - These are a lot easier to replace in some cases being a serperate small power PCB board in the device.  I can also solder and replace USB ports if needed.</p>
