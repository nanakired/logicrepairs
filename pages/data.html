	<p>If you have managed to squirrel your data away for a rainy day and cannot find it, maybe we can help.  Although this is never guaranteed, we strive to find new ways to recover your data.</p>
    <p>First rule though, please backup your data, either online or offline storage, preferably both.</p>

      <h3>Data Recovery</h3>
      <p>If you have deleted a file or formatted an entire hard drive by accident, even had malware affect your data, maybe I can help.  I have the hardware and software specifically for data recovery.</p>
      <h3>Data Backup</h3>
      <p>If you have media I can backup your data to, I can assist with this.  But it should be said, I do not hold any data, I am not a data center.</p>
      <p>That being said I can also assist you in what type of media you can use depending on the situation.</p>
