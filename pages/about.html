        <h2>About Me</h2>
       <p>This bit will be a showcase of my setup.  I have a 'micro home-lab' on the network with an array of Raspberry Pis which are organised as a NAS server, a web server and one for me to program and play about on, learning and familiarising myself with the Linux environment.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>My daily drive is my PC which is Windows 11.  A modest setup:</p>
        <div class="listsection">
           <ul> Motherboard:    AsRock</ul>
           <ul> CPU:            AMD 5500 Series 3.6GHz</ul>
           <ul> Memory:         24 GB Corsair 2400Mhz</ul>
           <ul> Graphics Card:  AMD RX570 8GB</ul>
           <ul> Solid State:    1.5TB of SSDs including a Samsung 980</ul>
           <ul> Hard Drive:     2TB Standard 7200rpm drive</ul>
        </div>
        <br/>
        <p>This is built myself into a Corsair case with Air cooling and RGB with Corsair's iCue for a bit of flair.  I am painfully aware that this is a slow system in today's market.  Socket AM4 is 8 years old as of 2024 and I could upgrade the memory speed and the graphics card, I am working on it.</p>
        <p>This system does run Cyberpunk, so I am happy with it and with AMD and nVidia's own AI processing speeding things up, gave the system more longetivity.  It is a 5 year old system now.</p>

        <p>This website is very much a work in progress and is an AI assisted build, the AI started off by making a page, I then took that and put it into Notepad and Visual Studio and went through the code from there, tweaking the content and making the site 'pop' a bit more.  The purpose of this site is to showcase my HTML skills while keeping a basic website going, no Java needed.</p>
